# 'Die Hard' Jug Problem - Artificial Intelligence Labs

For the Labs during the first semester of 2021/2022 we were asked to implement the Jugs and the respective AI to solve it in the minimal steps possible.

+ First it was for the [8-puzzle Problem](https://github.com/topics/8-puzzle-problem). 
+ Next, we had to adapt it to the Jug problem with the first Jug having 8 of capacity, the second Jug having 5 of capacity, and the last Jug having 3 of capacity. We used the [Best-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search).
+ Lastly, we had to make the problem generalized, giving the sizes of how many Jugs we wanted. For this we used the [A* Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).
